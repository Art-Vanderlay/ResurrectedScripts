# Scrilog v3.0
Script used for building Resurrection Remix
> Android M is the only supported version for scrilog

## How to build with Scrilog:
Firstly, set your hardware for building and download the primary source code.
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/ResurrectionRemix/scrilog
cd scrilog
./setup.sh
./download.sh
```
After setting up, cd to the source code folder directory and run the build script
```
cd ~/android/rr/
./build.sh
```
The build script will then prompt you for 2 types of information.
